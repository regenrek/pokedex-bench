# Pokédex benchmark

**GPT-6 Astra was fastest and is the benchmark author's visual favorite. Astra + DeepSeek produced the strongest code.** All three worked in ordinary use, and all three still need robustness fixes.

[**Try all three Pokédex apps in your browser**](https://kevinkern.dev/benchmarks/pokedex). Switch between models and explore the working apps.

Three implementations of the same task, reviewed independently by Fable 5.1 and Codex. Build a physical red Pokédex with real [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) data, the original 151 Pokémon, search, keyboard navigation, caching, and a usable mobile layout.

## GPT-6 Astra

GPT-6 Astra (`gpt-6-astra`) worked alone in Codex Desktop with medium reasoning effort.

**Fastest prototype and fewest recorded tokens.**

The app worked in ordinary use, but too much behavior and presentation lives in one component.

## GPT-6 Astra + DeepSeek V4.1 Flash

GPT-6 Astra (`gpt-6-astra`, medium reasoning) led the work in Codex Desktop. DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (`deepseek-flash`, max reasoning) implemented the app and a repair pass through DeepSeek Harness. Astra supplied the architecture, reviewed the result, and made final corrections.

**Strongest code and the best starting point for a maintained app.**

This implementation has clearer state and data boundaries, although the additional robustness probes still found cache defects.

## DeepSeek V4.1 Flash

DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (`deepseek-flash`) worked alone in DeepSeek Harness with max reasoning effort.

The code has useful separation but more confirmed interaction bugs, including a late retry replacing the selected Pokémon and male Nidoran resolving to the female entry.

Desktop screenshots show the initial Bulbasaur screen at 1440 × 900. Mobile screenshots show full pages captured at a 390 × 844 viewport. Each app scrolls vertically.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.12 or newer. Choose one project folder, then run the same commands.

- [GPT-6 Astra](pokedex-astra)
- [GPT-6 Astra + DeepSeek V4.1 Flash](pokedex-deepseek-v4.1-astra)
- [DeepSeek V4.1 Flash](pokedex-deepseek-v4.1-harness)

```bash
cd pokedex-astra
npm ci
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

The application source is unchanged. This repository contains the three projects, this summary, and comparison images. Raw transcripts, logs, private measurement records, generated builds, and temporary evaluation files stay out of Git.

This is one task with one submitted attempt per run. Model and harness names come from the recorded execution configurations. The reviews are independent, although visible folder names compromised blinding. The results describe these submissions and do not establish a general model ranking.
